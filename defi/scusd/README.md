## Overview

SCUSD is a decentralized, over-collateralized stablecoin on the Prism blockchain.
Users mint SCUSD by depositing PRISM tokens as collateral at a minimum 150%
collateralization ratio. The peg to $1 USD is maintained through a combination of
collateral requirements, liquidation mechanics, and arbitrage incentives.

## Features

- **Mint SCUSD** -- Deposit PRISM tokens to mint SCUSD at 150% minimum collateralization
- **Burn and Redeem** -- Burn SCUSD to unlock deposited PRISM collateral
- **Dynamic Collateral Ratio** -- Oracle-fed PRISM price determines real-time ratio
- **Liquidation** -- Vaults below 150% collateralization can be liquidated
- **Stability Fee** -- Annual fee accrued on minted SCUSD, paid on redemption
- **Global Debt Ceiling** -- Protocol-level cap on total SCUSD supply

## Peg Mechanism
