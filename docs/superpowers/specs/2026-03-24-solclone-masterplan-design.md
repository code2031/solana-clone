# Prism Masterplan: Best Crypto Experience in the World

**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Status:** Approved
**Scope:** Full ecosystem upgrade across 5 phases

---

## Goal

Transform Prism from a Solana fork into a standalone, best-in-class Layer 1 blockchain with the best user experience, developer experience, and feature set of any crypto project. Each phase builds on the previous, creating compounding value.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation

**Timeline target:** 4-6 weeks
**Objective:** Make the wallet world-class and the dev experience frictionless.

### 1.1 Wallet UX Overhaul (Flutter)

Redesign the Flutter wallet to match or exceed Phantom's quality:

- **Instant onboarding**: Create wallet in 3 taps. Biometric lock. No seed phrase required upfront (delayed backup prompt).
- **Token auto-discovery**: Automatically detect and display all SPL tokens in the wallet. Show USD values, 24h change, portfolio chart.
- **Transaction preview**: Before signing, show a human-readable breakdown: "Send 5.2 PRISM to 7xK2...nP4" with fee estimate.
- **Swap integration**: In-app token swap (calls the Phase 2 DEX when available, mock UI for now).
- **Collectibles tab**: NFT gallery with grid view, full-screen detail, send.
- **Activity feed**: Rich transaction history with type icons, counterparty labels, status badges.
- **Dark + Light themes**: Default dark with purple/green gradient. Light theme option.
- **Animations**: Smooth page transitions, pull-to-refresh spring, balance count-up, skeleton loading.
- **Multi-account**: Support multiple wallets, easy switching.
- **WalletConnect**: Connect to DApps via QR scan or deep link.

### 1.2 Developer Experience

- **Faucet web UI**: Next.js app at `faucet/` — enter address, select amount, get devnet SOL. Rate-limited.
- **SDK playground**: Interactive web-based code editor where developers can write and test SDK calls against devnet. Powered by Monaco editor + live RPC.
- **Anchor templates**: Pre-built Anchor program templates: token, NFT collection, escrow, voting, staking pool.
- **`prism init`**: CLI command that scaffolds a new Anchor project pre-configured for Prism networks.
- **Improved docs site**: Docusaurus or similar, auto-generated API docs from the SDK, tutorials, guides.

### 1.3 Performance Baseline

- **Validator tuning**: Optimize `validator-config.sh` for maximum throughput — account indexing, snapshot intervals, compute limits.
- **Benchmark suite**: Script that measures TPS, block time, confirmation latency against the local testnet. Baseline for future improvements.
- **Health dashboard**: Public status page showing network health (slot height, TPS, validator count, epoch progress).

## Phase 2: DeFi Core

**Timeline target:** 6-8 weeks
**Objective:** Give the chain real economic utility with a DEX, lending, and stablecoin.

### 2.1 AMM DEX (SolSwap)

On-chain automated market maker, similar to Raydium/Orca:

- **Constant-product pools**: x * y = k formula for any SPL token pair.
- **Liquidity provision**: Users deposit equal-value pairs, receive LP tokens.
- **Swap routing**: Multi-hop routing for pairs without direct pools (A→B→C).
- **Fee structure**: 0.3% per swap — 0.25% to LPs, 0.05% to protocol treasury.
- **Concentrated liquidity** (stretch): Uniswap v3-style range orders for capital efficiency.
- **Web UI**: Next.js swap interface with token selector, slippage settings, price impact warnings.
- **SDK integration**: `SolSwap.swap(tokenA, tokenB, amount)` in the web3.js SDK.

### 2.2 Lending Protocol (SolLend)

Supply and borrow against collateral:

- **Supply markets**: Deposit tokens, earn interest. Interest rates adjust algorithmically based on utilization.
- **Borrow**: Borrow against deposited collateral. LTV ratios per asset.
- **Liquidation**: When collateral value drops below threshold, liquidators can repay debt and claim collateral at a discount.
- **Interest rate model**: Kinked curve — low rates at low utilization, steep increase above 80%.
- **Web UI**: Dashboard showing supplied/borrowed positions, APY, health factor.

### 2.3 Stablecoin (SCUSD)

Over-collateralized stablecoin pegged to $1:

- **Mint**: Deposit PRISM as collateral (150% collateralization ratio), mint SCUSD.
- **Redeem**: Return SCUSD, get collateral back minus stability fee.
- **Liquidation**: If collateral ratio drops below 120%, position is liquidated.
- **Price feed**: On-chain oracle aggregating prices from multiple sources.

### 2.4 Price Oracle

On-chain price feed program:

- **Push model**: Authorized publishers submit price updates.
- **Aggregation**: Median of multiple publishers, confidence interval.
- **Staleness protection**: Prices expire after configurable time window.
- **Feeds**: PRISM/USD, SCUSD/USD, BTC/USD, ETH/USD.

## Phase 4: Cross-Chain + Privacy

**Timeline target:** 8-10 weeks
**Objective:** Connect Prism to the broader crypto ecosystem and add privacy features.

### 4.1 Cross-Chain Bridges

- **Ethereum bridge**: Lock ETH/ERC-20 on Ethereum, mint wrapped tokens on Prism. Uses a validator set to attest deposits.
- **Bitcoin bridge**: Lock BTC via multi-sig, mint scBTC on Prism.
- **Solana bridge**: Transfer SPL tokens between real Solana and Prism. Same token standard makes this straightforward.
- **Bridge UI**: Unified interface — select source chain, token, amount, destination. Track bridge status.

### 4.2 Privacy

- **Confidential transfers**: SPL Token-2022 confidential transfer extension — hide transfer amounts using Pedersen commitments and range proofs.
- **Private token standard**: Shielded pool where token balances and transfers are hidden. Deposit public tokens into the pool, transfer privately within it, withdraw back to public.
- **ZK proof system**: Use Groth16 or PLONK proofs verified on-chain.

### 4.3 Multi-Chain Wallet

Upgrade the Flutter wallet to support multiple chains in one app:

- **Ethereum**: View ETH/ERC-20 balances, send, receive. Import MetaMask seed.
- **Bitcoin**: View BTC balance, send, receive. BIP84 (native SegWit) derivation.
- **Solana**: Connect to real Solana alongside Prism.
- **Unified portfolio**: Total portfolio value across all chains.

- **Voting**: Token-weighted voting. 3-day voting period. 10% quorum.
- **Timelock**: Approved proposals execute after 2-day timelock. Emergency proposals (2/3 supermajority) execute in 6 hours.
- **Treasury**: DAO controls the ecosystem fund (150M PRISM from genesis).
- **Delegation**: Delegate voting power to representatives.

### 5.2 Community Infrastructure

- **Grant program**: Apply for ecosystem grants (funded by DAO treasury). Categories: DeFi, tooling, education, infrastructure.
- **Validator marketplace**: Browse validators, compare commission/uptime/stake, delegate directly from the wallet.
- **Launchpad**: New projects launch tokens with fair distribution — fixed-price sales, lottery, or auction. Integrated with the DEX for day-one liquidity.
- **On-chain profiles**: Link wallet to display name, avatar, bio. Used across marketplace, explorer, governance.
- **Developer bounty board**: Post bounties for features/bugs, pay in PRISM on completion.
