## Architecture

Rust BPF on-chain program with a Next.js App Router frontend. Proposals store
executable instruction sets that run after timelock expiry. Vote weight is determined
by PRISM token balance at the proposal creation slot, captured via a snapshot
mechanism. The timelock is enforced by comparing `Clock::unix_timestamp` against
the queued timestamp plus the configured delay.

The treasury is a PDA-controlled token account. Only executed proposals can
invoke treasury transfers. A guardian multisig can cancel proposals in emergencies
but cannot execute them directly.
