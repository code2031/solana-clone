## Architecture

Rust BPF on-chain program with a Next.js App Router frontend. The program stores
listing, auction, and offer state in PDAs derived from the NFT mint address. Royalty
enforcement happens at the program level during every transfer that involves payment.

The frontend uses wallet-adapter for transaction signing and an event-based indexer
to populate the activity feed and collection stats. Metadata and images are referenced
via Arweave/IPFS URIs stored in the Metaplex token metadata account.
