## Overview

SolMart is a full-featured NFT marketplace built on Prism. It provides an on-chain
Rust program for all marketplace operations and a Next.js web interface for browsing
collections, minting new NFTs, listing items for sale, placing bids in auctions, and
making offers. Creator royalties are enforced on-chain for every secondary sale.

## Features

- **Minting** -- Create NFTs with metadata, image URI, and optional collection assignment
- **Fixed-Price Listings** -- List NFTs at a set price in PRISM tokens
- **English Auctions** -- Time-bound auctions with minimum bid increments
- **Offers** -- Make and accept offers on any NFT, even unlisted ones
- **Collections** -- Group NFTs into verified collections with on-chain association
- **Creator Royalties** -- Enforced royalty percentage (up to 10%) on every secondary sale
- **Activity Feed** -- Track mints, sales, listings, bids, and transfers in real time
